CHANGELOG
- v1.2
    1)  Application can be called without output parameters. The B-COSFIRE filter response and the corresponding segmented image are visualized. 
 
- v1.1 
    1)  Feature for the computation of the orientation map added.
    2)  B-COSFIRE filter configuration performed on a vertical-oriented 
        prototype pattern as described in [1]

- v1.0
    Initial release
