function std_image=compute_std_image(Y,y_1,y_2)
%% COMPUTE_STD_IMAGE  Compute the standard deviation image of the difference of a movie Y and a tensor product.
%
% Input: 
% Y                     2D-array of size (M,N)
% y_1                   M x 1 array
% y_2                   1 x N array
%
% Output:
% std_image             Standard deviation image
%
% To compute the standard deviation image of the difference of a movie and a tensor product 
% without computing the difference, and thereby saving memory, the expression 
% for the computation of the variance is expanded and reformulated for each summand in terms of 
% movie and factors of the tensor product.
